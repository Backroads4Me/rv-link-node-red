// RV-C Address Claim Success Function
// Called after 250ms timer expires - finalizes address claim if no conflict lost
// Reference: RV-C Spec Section 3.3.2 - Source Address Claiming
//
// IMPORTANT: This does NOT send a second ADDRESS_CLAIMED message.
// We already sent ADDRESS_CLAIMED at the start of the process.
// Success = 250ms timer expires without losing a conflict.

// Get the address we were trying to claim when this timer started
